## Registration information

**Registration will remain open until May 20th.**

Our compromise is to keep the Summer School **free** and easily accessible. Therefore, no registration fees are considered. However, we have a limited number of simultaneous online participants, which is why we encourage all interested persons to fill the registration <a href="https://forms.gle/xaXRanSDykqdM2UdA" target="_blank">form</a> so we can approximate the numbers and plan accordingly.  

We will verify the eligibility status of all the received applications, and notify you if your application is (or not) accepted. For this, we ask you to join the following <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mexican_nlp_summer_school" target="_blank">group</a>. If your application gets accepted, you'll be immediately admitted into the forum, the main communication channel with all participants.  

The registration form is <a href="https://forms.gle/xaXRanSDykqdM2UdA" target="_blank">here</a>.

The Google group of the Mexican NLP Summer School is <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mexican_nlp_summer_school" target="_blank">here</a>.

We are looking forward to welcoming you to this great event!!
