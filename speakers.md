      <h3>Talk title: "The Other Side(s) of Word Embeddings" </h3>
      Word embeddings have largely been a "success story" in our field. They have enabled progress in numerous language processing applications, and have facilitated the application of large-scale language analyses in other domains, such as social sciences and humanities.  While less talked about, word embeddings also have many shortcomings -- instability, lack of transparency, biases, and more. In this talk, I will review the "ups" and "downs" of word embeddings, discuss  tradeoffs, and chart potential future research directions to address some of the downsides of these word representations.

      <h3>Talk title: "How to Write a History Book?"</h3>
      Understanding events and communicating about events are fundamental human activities. However, it's much more difficult to remember event-related information compared to entity-related information. For example, most people in Mexico will be able to answer the question "Which city is Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México is located in?", but very few people can give a complete answer to "Who died from COVID-19？". Human-written history books are often incomplete and highly biased because "History is written by the victors". In this talk I will present a new research direction on event-centric knowledge base construction from multimedia multilingual sources, and then perform consistency checking and reasoning to detect and correct misinformation. Our minds represent events at various levels of granularity and abstraction, which allows us to quickly access and reason about old and new scenarios. Progress in natural language understanding and computer vision has helped automate some parts of event understanding but the current, first-generation, automated event understanding is overly simplistic since it is local, sequential and flat. Real events are hierarchical and probabilistic. Understanding them requires knowledge in the form of a repository of abstracted event schemas (complex event templates), understanding the progress of time, using background knowledge, and performing global inference. Our approach to second-generation event understanding builds on an incidental supervision approach to inducing an event schema repository that is probabilistic, hierarchically organized and semantically coherent. This facilitates inducing higher-level event representations analysts can interact with, and allow them to guide further reasoning and extract events by constructing a novel structured cross-media cross-lingual common semantic space. To understand the many facets of such complex, dynamic situations, we have developed various novel methods to induce hierarchical narrative graph schemas and apply them to enhance end-to-end joint neural Information Extraction, event coreference resolution, event time prediction, and misinformation detection.

			<h3>Tutorial: “Language (de)standardisation and NLP”</h3>
			   The term non-standard language covers all linguistic expressions not conforming to an official orthography and pronunciation. Such expressions include dialects (written and spoken), historical texts and social media posts. They require special processing techniques in order to deal with the fact that the same word can be written (or pronounced) very differently in the same text (or recording). This tutorial will provide an introduction to the notion of language standard and an overview of the challenges that increasingly non-standard writing and speech pose to NLP. We will try out text normalisation as a technique to deal with noisy text and discuss other potential approaches.

      My research interests revolve around the problem of computational efficiency and model accuracy on deep and wide machine learning algorithms including the ethical and societal implications of its applications. This involves basic research in the core tenets of machine learning, and large-scale data mining with applications in big data analytics, large-scale multidimensional multispectral signal analysis, natural language processing, computer vision, and health-care imaging. I have worked on support vector machines for regression on massively large datasets and proposed efficient and computationally tractable training algorithms, which provides a focus for my research on large-scale machine learning applications. My interest in deep learning has led me to investigate its accuracy in the detection of leukocoria, which is a symptom of retinal cancer, and producing a software product freely available to the world thanks to our multidisciplinary, collaborative, research team. My research has also explored many problems in the general areas of applied mathematics, numerical optimization, swarm intelligence optimization, evolutionary algorithms, soft computing, fuzzy logic, and neurofuzzy systems.

			<h3>Tutorial: “Redes Neuronales: conceptos básicos y aplicaciones”</h3>
			   En este tutorial se pretende dar una visión introductoria al paradigma de las Redes Neuronales Artificiales (RNA). Se describirá brevemente el funcionamiento de las RNA y se mostrará cómo a través de la combinación de unidades simples de procesamiento (neuronas) interconectadas operando de forma paralela, se consigue resolver problemas complejos. Mediante la utilización de las notebooks de Colab, se desarrollarán aplicaciones que implementen RNA para el reconocimiento de formas o patrones, predicción y clasificación, utilizando el lenguaje Python. Como objetivo final se pretende proporcionar al participante, las bases que le permitan discernir cuándo y cómo poder aplicar este modelo computacional, entendiendo la “magia” que hay detrás de las RNA.

			<h3>Tutorial: “An introduction to speech-based technologies for Natural Language Processing applications”</h3>
      Since the last two decades, the amount of data generated and collected has grown exponentially, and especially through the rise of unstructured data such as images, videos or text. More recently, audio and speech data have gained a large interest, for example through voice assistants. Companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon have shown an increasing interest in professionals with skills and tools for 'understanding' and 'transforming' the massive flow of speech data in relevant information. Some of the most important speech-based technologies are voice activity detection, speaker diarization and identification, and automatic speech recognition. These techologies are often used as an input to various NLP applications afterwards. This brief workshop will give you a set of basic tools for grasping the main aspects of speech-based technologies and how they can be implemented in real-life cases.
