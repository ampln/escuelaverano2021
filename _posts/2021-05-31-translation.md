To all participants that will be attending the 6th edition of the Mexican NLP summer School, we are glad to inform you that thanks to the support of the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana, Unidad Cuajimalpa, we will have available the service of **simultaneous translation** English-Spanish-English.

This service will be available only for those attendees that join through Zoom, using the zoom app, in a Windows or MacOS operating system. Please consider that if you connect through a Linux-based OS system the simultaneous translation will not be possible to activate. Also, take note that the simultaneous translation won't be available during the live streaming on YouTube.
